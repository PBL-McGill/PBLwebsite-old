 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used to amplify and identify DNA samples. Most commercial PCR systems require over an hour to produce a result, but we have recently demonstrated a new approach that uses laser heating of gold nanoparticles to drive the reaction. This has allowed us to produce test results in under five minutes and opens the technique up to point-of-care applications.
